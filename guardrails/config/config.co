# BEND/guardrails/config/config.co
# Defines the core behavior of the guardrails.

# 1. Define custom LLM and embeddings for the guardrails if needed.
#    For now, we'll use the defaults which are sufficient for rule-based checks.

# 2. Define a user intent for when the agent wants to run a tool.
define user express intent to run tool
  "I want to run the tool named '{$tool_name}' with arguments '{$tool_args}'"

# 3. Define a flow that uses this intent to block a dangerous command.
define flow block dangerous shell commands
  user express intent to run tool

  # Check if the tool is 'run_local_command' and if its 'command' argument
  # contains the dangerous 'rm -rf' string.
  if $tool_name == "run_local_command" and "rm -rf" in $tool_args.command
    bot inform user of blocked command
    stop

# 4. Define the bot's response when the command is blocked.
define bot inform user of blocked command
  "I'm sorry, I cannot execute that command. It contains a dangerous pattern ('rm -rf') and has been blocked by security guardrails."
